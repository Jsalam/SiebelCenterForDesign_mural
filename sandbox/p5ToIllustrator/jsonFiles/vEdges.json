He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer.

The electrostatic gyroscope was created at the University of Illinois by Howard Knoebel. The electrostatic gyroscope was initially invented to be used in submarines - which needed an instrument that would not need to be calibrated since it would be submerged for up to 30 days at a time. This device though would later be used in satellites to help them navigate space.",

A prominent figure in Science Fiction, the black hole has a lot of unknowns. But through study and research of the space around the black hole, as well as other measurements, NCSA has been able to visualize and create artistic renderings of ways to show how a black hole operates. Examples include numeric models to detect gravitational waves from black holes colliding,oration with the telescope located in Chile and the data being stored in Champaign Urbana. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications will store the 10 years worth of data, collecting about 20 terabytes of image data a night beginning in 2023. The data will be processed into reports as well as alerting researchers in near-real time of new and unexpected astronomical events.",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

This tilt makes it easier for astronomers to study star formation. Based on what they are able to see, they decided to focus on molecular clouds as a base for star formation. They used a telescope in Australia to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud straight on to view those molecular clouds.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

But through study and research of the space around the black hole, as well as other measurements, NCSA has been able to visualize and create artistic renderings of ways to show how a black hole operates. Examples include numeric models to detect gravitational waves from black holes colliding,oration with the telescope located in Chile and the data being stored in Champaign Urbana. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications will store the 10 years worth of data, collecting about 20 terabytes of image data a night beginning in 2023.

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans.

They take four variables, which are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall and snow depth, and assign each a value. The scores are then totaled for each day and are added to the index. The index is useful in analyzing trends over one season as well as comparing the current season to past winters. It helps to look at patterns of severity of winter, with the ability to look at more specific geographical areas and can help assist with studying changes in climate. ",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

The index is useful in analyzing trends over one season as well as comparing the current season to past winters.

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

Wong and his team hope to use this information to understand our own galaxy. Wong used the Large Magellanic Cloud (nearby galaxy) to study, as it it tilted face-on. This tilt makes it easier for astronomers to study star formation. Based on what they are able to see, they decided to focus on molecular clouds as a base for star formation. They used a telescope in Australia to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud straight on to view those molecular clouds.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

This tilt makes it easier for astronomers to study star formation. Based on what they are able to see, they decided to focus on molecular clouds as a base for star formation.

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

      "nodeDescription": "Psychology graduate student Faith Shin conducted research on how different messages within Christianity were linked to how people viewed and responded to climate change. Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

The goal ofy wanted to focus on this research was to help fix policies surrounding civil unrest, and help leaders helping areas know how long unrest can last after a climate change event.

When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

The electrostatic gyroscope was created at the University of Illinois by Howard Knoebel. The electrostatic gyroscope was initially invented to be used in submarines - which needed an instrument that would not need to be calibrated since it would be submerged for up to 30 days at a time. This device though would later be used in satellites to help them navigate space.",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

With the new changes to the coast and to the water, older members of the Houma tribe find it difficult to pass on their traditions to youngermembers, causing distress. This climate change and destruction of the coast has caused a nation to reevaluate their way of life and their traditions.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

      "nodeDescription": "The University of Illinois has been studying the relationship between nature and humans since its earliest days. From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

They found that areas where there waswho use violence prior to a climate change event were more likely to have increased violence after a natural disaster. The goal ofy wanted to focus on this research was to help fix policies surrounding civil unrest, and help leaders helping areas know how long unrest can last after a climate change event. To figure out this research, Nardulli and his team used a random sample of storms and floods and examined looked at data surrounding civil unrest in the affected areas to complete this research in certain cities affected by the climate change events.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

This tilt makes it easier for astronomers to study star formation. Based on what they are able to see, they decided to focus on molecular clouds as a base for star formation.

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

This research facility focused on increasing scientific understanding of the work productivity of the human body (achieved through fitness tests), developing standards for those fitness tests, diagnosing physical conditions based on fitness test results, and creating conditioning exercises. Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

      "nodeDescription": "Dr. Timothy Nugent, a professor Rehabilitation Education, pioneered the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949. He created this league to help destigmatize those with disabilities, aiming to change the societal and cultural views towards disability. This idea initially began after World War II, where Nugent found it necessary to create programs for wounded veterans. Nugent's league eventually included both men's and women's teams that played in the Olympics in 1968, and can still be seen playing here at the University, maintaining Nugent's original view of a destigmatized sport.",

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

On the night in question, the inferometer was able to get measurements of Sputnik and were able to use Doppler Radar data. Members of the department used the data from the Doppler and inferometer to study its orbit. This data helped advance sateillite-based astronomical research and was helped with grants from the National Research Council, NASA, and the Air Force.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Along with Hergenrother and Fan, one of the main researchers was a daschund with a brain tumor named Pretzel, who acted as one of the test dogs, with success. Pretzel, after going through treatment with PAC-1 and standard cancer treatment, had her tumor shrinked and her life expectancy extended. ",

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

Bosak-Schroder thinks that these ethnographies can help current leaders find ways to view and fix climate change issues.

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

      "nodeDescription": "Dr. Timothy Nugent, a professor Rehabilitation Education, pioneered the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949. He created this league to help destigmatize those with disabilities, aiming to change the societal and cultural views towards disability. This idea initially began after World War II, where Nugent found it necessary to create programs for wounded veterans. Nugent's league eventually included both men's and women's teams that played in the Olympics in 1968, and can still be seen playing here at the University, maintaining Nugent's original view of a destigmatized sport.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Wong and his team hope to use this information to understand our own galaxy. Wong used the Large Magellanic Cloud (nearby galaxy) to study, as it it tilted face-on. This tilt makes it easier for astronomers to study star formation. Based on what they are able to see, they decided to focus on molecular clouds as a base for star formation. They used a telescope in Australia to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud straight on to view those molecular clouds.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

The IDEA coalition quickly gained ground, hosting a national symposium in 2019, a mental-health film screening in both 2018 and 2019, and many other meetings. By this past spring (2020), the coalition received four funding awards to maintain their research, which they do along with students, faculty, and patients.

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

They found that areas where there waswho use violence prior to a climate change event were more likely to have increased violence after a natural disaster. The goal ofy wanted to focus on this research was to help fix policies surrounding civil unrest, and help leaders helping areas know how long unrest can last after a climate change event. To figure out this research, Nardulli and his team used a random sample of storms and floods and examined looked at data surrounding civil unrest in the affected areas to complete this research in certain cities affected by the climate change events.",

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

This research facility focused on increasing scientific understanding of the work productivity of the human body (achieved through fitness tests), developing standards for those fitness tests, diagnosing physical conditions based on fitness test results, and creating conditioning exercises. Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

The dancers go at their own pace and utilize the space in ways that their ability can afford them to.

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

The IDEA coalition quickly gained ground, hosting a national symposium in 2019, a mental-health film screening in both 2018 and 2019, and many other meetings. By this past spring (2020), the coalition received four funding awards to maintain their research, which they do along with students, faculty, and patients.

The dancers go at their own pace and utilize the space in ways that their ability can afford them to.

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

He was a Professor of Municipal and Sanitary Engineering (now housed within the Civil and Environmental Engineering department) who contributed his mathematical and engineering skills to make railroad trips more comfortable and more efficient, as railway travel was predominant in the late 19th century.

When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

A rigid frame bridge was the popular design of the 1920s and was simply made of one piece of reinforced concrete. This idea was created to resist bending and tears, and, was cheaper to construct and maintain than previous types of bridges. Wilson's contribution to the rigid frame bridge was the concept that bolts would be better than rivets for the construction of the bridge. Linked to his interest in nuts and bolts, Wilson also helped in the creation of the Research Council on Riveted and Bolt Joints, putting his theory into practice.",

His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

Bosak-Schroder thinks that these ethnographies can help current leaders find ways to view and fix climate change issues.

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Part of that research helped Bevier figure out the idea to use a thermometer to promote safe cooking of meat, applying key aspects of chemistry to promote food safety. To do this, she worked in tandem with the Department of Animal Husbandry. ",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

A rigid frame bridge was the popular design of the 1920s and was simply made of one piece of reinforced concrete. This idea was created to resist bending and tears, and, was cheaper to construct and maintain than previous types of bridges. Wilson's contribution to the rigid frame bridge was the concept that bolts would be better than rivets for the construction of the bridge. Linked to his interest in nuts and bolts, Wilson also helped in the creation of the Research Council on Riveted and Bolt Joints, putting his theory into practice.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

Bosak-Schroder thinks that these ethnographies can help current leaders find ways to view and fix climate change issues. She also focuses on how people are educated about climate issues, which is another way that these ancient words can help influence modern thinking.",

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

This course and thought method (?) also included a variety of people to help Lohmann with his lectures, including Henry Wright (town planner) and T.F. Frison (conservationist).

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

What makes this interesting is that one of the women lived twenty month longer after doing the ultrasound procedure.

A rigid frame bridge was the popular design of the 1920s and was simply made of one piece of reinforced concrete. This idea was created to resist bending and tears, and, was cheaper to construct and maintain than previous types of bridges. Wilson's contribution to the rigid frame bridge was the concept that bolts would be better than rivets for the construction of the bridge. Linked to his interest in nuts and bolts, Wilson also helped in the creation of the Research Council on Riveted and Bolt Joints, putting his theory into practice.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Regional planning is the focus on the organization of communities and areas for a large piece of land rather than a city or town. This is a different type of planning that utilizes different space and types of land usage. This course and thought method (?) also included a variety of people to help Lohmann with his lectures, including Henry Wright (town planner) and T.F. Frison (conservationist). This concept combines the ideas of urban planning with a natural approach to larger areas of land, as he aimed to teach his students about the planning on a larger scale than just urban planning.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

In 1900, Bevier created the Home Economics Program essentially from scratch, having no precedent to look to. With this freedom, she created a program that focused on the health aspects of home economics and nutrition. Part of that research helped Bevier figure out the idea to use a thermometer to promote safe cooking of meat, applying key aspects of chemistry to promote food safety. To do this, she worked in tandem with the Department of Animal Husbandry. ",

The IDEA coalition quickly gained ground, hosting a national symposium in 2019, a mental-health film screening in both 2018 and 2019, and many other meetings. By this past spring (2020), the coalition received four funding awards to maintain their research, which they do along with students, faculty, and patients.

His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

The app tells the nutritional data along with the carbon footprint. Mercier's goal is twofold: to help children be more \"data literate\" and learn more about the causes of climate change. To do this research, Mercier and her team videotaped children learning about climate change and their food carbon footprint. The focus on food was to look at what children have more control over, which makes climate change awareness and learning more accessible. ",

These ethnographies (ancient travelogues) look at differences in consumption, something that is more relevant now as we look to different things to eat in the wake of a changing climate. Bosak-Schroder thinks that these ethnographies can help current leaders find ways to view and fix climate change issues. She also focuses on how people are educated about climate issues, which is another way that these ancient words can help influence modern thinking.",

Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

He created this league to help destigmatize those with disabilities, aiming to change the societal and cultural views towards disability. This idea initially began after World War II, where Nugent found it necessary to create programs for wounded veterans. Nugent's league eventually included both men's and women's teams that played in the Olympics in 1968, and can still be seen playing here at the University, maintaining Nugent's original view of a destigmatized sport.",

His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories.

      "nodeDescription": "The University of Illinois has been studying the relationship between nature and humans since its earliest days. From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

Regional planning is the focus on the organization of communities and areas for a large piece of land rather than a city or town. This is a different type of planning that utilizes different space and types of land usage. This course and thought method (?) also included a variety of people to help Lohmann with his lectures, including Henry Wright (town planner) and T.F. Frison (conservationist). This concept combines the ideas of urban planning with a natural approach to larger areas of land, as he aimed to teach his students about the planning on a larger scale than just urban planning.",

His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

Shin found that messages linked to stewardship (God commands humans to take care of the Earth) often resulted in Christians viewing climate change concern as a moral imperative. This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article. An interesting find is that while the stewardship articles showed an increase inmore moral concern about climate change, the dominion articles did not reduce moral concerns.",

Beyond those initial goals, the lab also researched the effects of exercise with regards to health as well as studying what makes athletes successful. Some major tests that Cureton had a hand in included: Cureton Muscular Endurance Test, the Cureton test of Swimming Endurance, the Illinois 14-item motor fitness test, the Cureton All-Out Treadmill Run test, the Cureton-Illinois Motor Fitness Test, and the Cureton Flexibility Test.

Rose found in the 1930s that rats, when fed a variety of amino acids, would die until they ingested \"casein\" in milk. Rose, figuring that casein included an essential amino acid to life, eventually discovered threonine. After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids. This research was awared the National Medal of Science in biological sciences in 1966. So, we ought to thank William C. Rose for helping us know what food is best for us!",

His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

This idea was created to resist bending and tears, and, was cheaper to construct and maintain than previous types of bridges. Wilson's contribution to the rigid frame bridge was the concept that bolts would be better than rivets for the construction of the bridge. Linked to his interest in nuts and bolts, Wilson also helped in the creation of the Research Council on Riveted and Bolt Joints, putting his theory into practice.",

Stoughton St in Urbana, Il, was built in 1924 as a collaboration between UIUC and the National Warm Air Heating and Ventilating Association to research heating in private homes. The team conducted many experiments to test out different heating systems. This would be a trial and error system to determine what heating system should be kept or scrapped. This residence was a hands-on and real time experiment to see how heating and different materials would work in a home. The success of Research Residence No. 1 led to the creation of other research homes. ",

Prior to the Holland Tunnel, tunnels were generally smaller in scope and did not have many issues in ventilation. The Holland Tunnel, however, was longer and needed new ventilation. The issue was passed to researchers from the University of Illinois. Yale, and the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The University of Illinois came up with a new design of 84 fans in the tunnel, with 42 providing fresh air and 42 expelling the harmful carbon dioxide, allowing the air supply to be replenished every 1.6 minutes. This system was tested in 1949 when a tanker truck carrying carbon disulfide exploded. The ventilation system allowed the tunnel to reopen after 56 hours after the tunnel had been exposed to extreme temperatures and harmful gases.",
