They then used this data to analyze the molecular structure of interstellar gas.",

    nodeDescription:
      "i. Measuring a starâ€™s brightness would take hours of observation and calculations. Astronomy professor Joel Stebbins in collaboration with physics professors F.C. Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",
